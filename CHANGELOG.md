# Changelog

ASPIRATIONAL - a short list of things that would be nice to implement
  - Fix crypto client side - the code is nearly there
  - Fix subscription publish lost notifications
  - Diagnostics
  - Session restore after disconnect in server
  - Session restore after disconnect in client
  - Integration tests where client connects to server, does something to test basic functionality

## 0.4
  - General
    - More rigorous security checks
  - Server side
    - The server network io has been changed to use tokio and futures. This makes the IO more asynchronous and should
      allow it to scale to a larger number of connections.
    - The server provides a basic web monitor / metrics interface which can be enabled through code.
    - Server will register itself periodically with a discovery server if discovery_server_url property is set in the
      config

## 0.3
  - General
    - Numerous enhancements
    - Replace a lot of conventional loops with iterators using filter, find, map, collect etc.
    - More impls of From<> and Into<> traits, replacing proprietary functions
    - Reduce the amount of imports by refactoring code, moving types to their own files
  - Core and types
    - StatusCode values have switched naming convention from BAD_UNEXPECTED to BadUnexpected 
    - Code generation produce nicer output with less unused imports
    - Generated types now go into types/src/service_types
    - Security channel code is more server / client agnostic
    - Crypto cert generator inserts a random serial # value which some 3rd party OPC impls check for
    - Implement NumericRange
    - Simplify implementation of DateTime
    - Simplify implementation of Guid
    - Fix some issues with numeric node ids serialization. Implement binary node ids
  - Client side
    - Add client side helpers that call most services implemented server side
    - Add a discovery api
    - Add configuration file support
    - Add subscription and monitored items support
    - A lot of work to get crypto working client side (but its not there yet)
  - Server side
    - Better implementation of subscription / monitored item.
    - Implement Republish
    - Revised config file format to more cleanly support different token types
    - Changes to how locks are held on major components like address space, server, session
    - Partial impl of discovery server
    - Partial impl of diagnostics 
  - Samples
    - simple-client now has a --subscribe arg to exercise new subscription APIs
    - New sample discovery-client demonstrates a client which calls a discovery server
    - New sample demo-server tests all standard OPC UA variant types. It will grow to add more in time.
    - Some http server stubbing done to allow metrics to be published. Not functional.
  
## 0.2 
  - server side crypto / pki architecture
  - Implements service calls that were stubbed or partially implemented in 0.1.
  - New sample chess-server
  - Improved test cases
  - Refactor code to reduce build times.
  
## 0.1 initial release 
  - Nano implementation
