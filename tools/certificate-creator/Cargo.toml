[dependencies]
# OpenSSL is optional due to problems building and installing it on some platforms.
# A certificate creator without openssl is basically useless!

[features]
# The default package is no crypto.
default = []

# Crypto relies on openssl which is a bit of a pain to setup. If you need it, follow the instructions at the link
# below before enabling the feature, e.g. "cargo build --features crypto"
