//! This module contains crypto related functionality. It is used for establishing
//! trust between a client and server via certificate exchange and validation. It also used for
//! encrypting / decrypting messages and signing messages.
//!
//! The module is an optional component of the stack. If it isn't compiled in, then the OPC UA
//! impl will not support encryption, decryption, signing or verification.
